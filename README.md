# SquidGamePlatforms
This is my part in my school's team's two week Squid Game sprint.
My assignment was to do a platform jumping scene where spotlights point a path to the other side
and if you fall or jump on the wrong platform, you fail the game.

My approach to this was very time friendly. I made multiple presets of different platform paths.
I tagged the right platforms with "GP"(good platform) and wrong platforms with "BP"(bad platform).
I put the presets into a list and then each playtime a random number determined which platforms and spotlights went active.
